With respect to the Barcode of Life Data (BOLD) system, it is vital that contributions occur from a variety of species and locations as this will result in a more complete and accurate understanding of biodiversity. Hence, the purpose of the study is to determine if financial and geographical biases are occurring in the BOLD database. The genera Oncorhynchus and Lepomis are investigated as both genera are relatively common and contain the same number of species. It is hypothesized that the genus Oncorhynchus will be more adequately represented in the BOLD database than Lepomis due to financial and geographical biases. In order to assess what genus is most accurately represented on the BOLD database two metrics are used: the number of records per species, and the number of contributing countries per species. If the genus Oncorhynchus is more adequately researched, then Oncorhynchus will have more records per species. Similarly, if the genus Oncorhynchus is better represented in the database, then the Oncorhynchus genus will have contributions from more countries per species.
